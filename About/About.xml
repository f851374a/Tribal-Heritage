	<description>The purpose of this mod is adding tribe-related items that will be useful in later stages of game so tribes can look like tribes even if they are about to build a spaceship. This includes:

	1. Three new war masks. They are helmets analogues that provide slightly less protection but have +10% pain shock threshold buff like basic war mask. They can be crafted by tribes only.
	2. Two new joy activities, mehen and akarala. They will replace poker and billiard for tribe faction.
	3. Two new advanced bow weapons. They can be crafted by any player faction.</description>
